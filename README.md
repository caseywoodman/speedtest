<!-- Purpose of Application -->

## PURPOSE

The purpose of this application is to allow the user to complete a coding quiz in a 30 second timer. Each incorrect answer removes 10 seconds. At the end of the questions, if the user is in the top 10 of the local storage database they are then prompted to enter their initials putting them on the "High Score" page.

## MY EXPERIENCE

This application is created mainly by using JavaScript. The HTML for this application is very basic, using the javascript to pull id tags to insert the question data, answer data, clearing HTML data, and much more.
